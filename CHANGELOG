snowplow-mobile 0.7.0 (2023-03-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrates our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` : 
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

### Redshift/Postgres custom contexts
The change in de-duplication logic means that now the `events_this_run` and downstream tables will contain events that may have duplicates within your self-describing-events or context tables. Previously these events were discarded do there was no risk of duplication when joining a sde/context in a custom model, you must now make sure to de-dupe your sde/context before joining in any custom models. See the `models/optional_modules/consent/scratch/default/snowplow_web_consent_events_this_run.sql` file for an example, and the docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#guidelines--best-practice).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Change de-duplication logic on redshift/postgres

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-mobile version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/mobile/#upgrading-to-0140)

snowplow-mobile 0.6.3 (2023-02-22)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release changes the severity on unique tests on `previous_session_id` columns to `warn` to deal with cases where data is ported to a new phone but both devices are then used. It also makes a change that allows for the `user_mapping` table to be disabled when user stitching is not enabled.

## Features

Move ref in enabled check (Close #61)
Reduce previous_session_id test severity to warn (Close #62)

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.  

snowplow-mobile 0.6.2 (2023-01-23)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release fixes an issue with using the Geolocation context for Databricks users.

## Features

Add action for generating docs for pages
Fix databricks geolocation aliasing (Close #57)

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.  

snowplow-mobile 0.6.1 (2022-12-13)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release alters the Databricks `snowplow_mobile_base_events_this_run` table to include all columns from the events table, in line with Snowflake and BigQuery.

## Features
Add all columns to `snowplow_mobile_base_events_this_run` for databricks.

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.  
Any custom models built directly off `snowplow_mobile_base_events_this_run` in databricks may need altering if you `select *` from this table.

snowplow-mobile 0.6.0 (2022-12-08)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This release drops support for dbt versions below 1.3.** In order to support the new dbt-utils major release, we need to drop support for dbt versions below 1.3. As a result, we've stopped using macros from dbt-utils which removes the deprecation warnings users were seeing.

## Features
Drop support for dbt versions below 1.3 (Close #49)
Add standard actions and templates + change int test schema in macro and model

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. **You will need dbt v1.3 at least to be able to use this version of the package.**
