# Snowplow Mobile Package

Welcome to the model documentation site for the Snowplow mobile dbt package. The package contains a fully incremental model, that transforms raw mobile event data generated by the [Snowplow iOS][ios-tracker] or [android trackers][android-tracker] into a series of derived tables of varying levels of aggregation.

**For more information, including a QuickStart guide, operation and configuration, and implementing your own custom modules on top of this please visit the [Snowplow Docs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/).**

*Note this model design doc site is linked to latest release of the package. If you are not using the latest release, [generate and serve](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-serve) the doc site locally for accurate documentation.*

## Overview

This model consists of a series of modules, each producing a table which serves as the input to the next module. The 'standard' modules are:

- Base: Performs the incremental logic, outputting the table `snowplow_mobile_base_events_this_run` which contains a de-duped data set of all events required for the current run of the model.
- Screen Views: Aggregates event level data to a screen view level, on `screen_view_id`.
- Sessions: Aggregates screen view level data to a session level, on `session_id`.
- Users: Aggregates session level data to a users level, on `device_user_id`.
- User Mapping: Provides a mapping between user identifiers, `device_user_id` and `user_id`. This can be used for session stitching.

Each module produces a table which acts as the input to the subsequent module (the `_this_run` tables), and updates a derived table - with the exception of the Base module, which takes atomic data as its input, and does not update a derived table.

## Installation
