{% docs table_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest %}

This incremental table is a manifest of all sessions that have been processed by the Snowplow dbt mobile model. For each session, the start and end timestamp is recorded.

By knowing the life-cycle of a session the model is able to able to determine which sessions and thus events to process for a given time-frame, as well as the complete date range required to reprocess all events of each session.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs table_base_new_event_limits %}

This table contains the lower and upper timestamp limits for the given run of the mobile model. These limits are used to select new events from the events table.

The sql to determine the correct limits for the run is generated by the `get_run_limits()` macro. Please refer to the documentation for details on how this macro determines the run limits.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs table_base_events_this_run %}

For any given run, this table contains all required events to be consumed by subsequent nodes in the Snowplow dbt mob package. This is a cleaned, de-duped dataset, containing all columns from the raw events table as well as having various optional contexts joined-on/unpacked.

**Note: This table should be used as the input to any custom modules that require event level data, rather than selecting straight from `atomic.events`**
